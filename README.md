# gameOfCraps_Python

This Python code simulates a simple Craps game.

How to Play:

Run the script.
You'll see the results of the initial dice roll.
If you roll a 7 or 11 on the first roll, you win!
If you roll a 2, 3, or 12 on the first roll, you lose.
If none of the above conditions occur, the game enters additional rounds.
In each additional round, you'll be prompted to roll again (y/n).
If you roll a 7 (craps), you lose.
If you roll the same number as your initial roll (your point), you win!
You can choose to stop rolling at any point by entering 'n' at the prompt.

Code Structure:

The code is organized within the play_dice_game() function.
It generates random dice rolls, checks win/lose conditions, and handles user input for additional rounds.
